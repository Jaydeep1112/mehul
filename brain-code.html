                                    <p><span class="dropcap">M</span>y journey into AI began with a deep curiosity about how technology could be used for meaningful change — particularly in healthcare. Combining my interests in medicine and artificial intelligence, I built a diagnostic model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect pneumonia in chest X-ray images. This wasn’t just an academic experiment; I developed and packaged the model into an intuitive software interface, ensuring it was accessible even to non-technical users. It became more than code — it became a practical tool with real-world potential. Presenting the project at school, I emphasized not just the technology, but its purpose: to raise awareness about the dangers of undiagnosed pneumonia and to inspire peers to see innovation as something within reach.</p>

                                    <p>That presentation was a turning point. It sparked meaningful conversations, especially with juniors, about the role of AI in health and everyday life. Recognizing the enthusiasm, I began mentoring students interested in coding and artificial intelligence, holding weekend sessions to simplify complex topics and guide them through beginner projects. These informal classes evolved into a nurturing learning space — one where young minds began experimenting, building, and asking bold questions. As more students and even parents from outside my school expressed interest, I began offering personalized coaching sessions. What had started as a passion project transitioned into a paid venture, giving me the opportunity to turn knowledge into mentorship and purpose into practice — all while supporting the growth of a budding community of student innovators.</p>

                                    <p>Beyond technical skills, this experience taught me lasting lessons in leadership, communication, and entrepreneurship. I learned how to transform an idea into a working solution, how to explain complex AI models to non-specialists, and how to guide others in their learning journey. More importantly, I discovered the power of impact — how technology becomes truly powerful not when it is complicated, but when it is compassionate. This project remains one of the most formative chapters of my academic life, reminding me that even as a student, I can lead with empathy, build with purpose, and spark change — one line of code at a time.</p>

                                    <p><span class="dropcap">M</span>otivated by a deep curiosity about how technology can support human well-being, I undertook a self-initiated research project to explore how artificial intelligence can transform the future of healthcare — from early diagnosis to personalized treatment plans. This was more than just a technical analysis; it became an investigation into the ethical, clinical, and technological dimensions of AI in medicine. I examined a wide range of models — from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used in medical imaging to natural language processing (NLP) for analyzing patient data, and even reinforcement learning applied in adaptive treatment systems. Drawing on case studies and academic literature from institutions like MIT and Stanford, I mapped the evolution of AI’s growing influence in modern medicine.</p>

                                    <p>Beyond theory, I put my knowledge to the test. Using real-world medical datasets from NIH and Kaggle, I experimented with machine learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch to build and evaluate diagnostic models. Throughout the process, I addressed critical questions that extended beyond performance metrics: Can AI reduce healthcare disparities? How do we ensure transparency in machine-led diagnoses? I discovered how training data quality directly impacts bias, and how AI models must be explainable, safe, and equitable before being applied in clinical environments. My findings culminated in a detailed report outlining the strengths and limitations of various AI models, as well as the challenges of implementing them ethically in hospitals — particularly where trust, fairness, and human oversight are non-negotiable.</p>

                                    <p>This research didn’t just shape me as a future technologist — it shaped me as a more conscious citizen. I presented my insights at school science and tech clubs, sparking discussions on AI ethics, biomedical informatics, and responsible innovation. To make the findings accessible, I created a simplified guide for younger students, helping them understand the promise and potential risks of AI in healthcare. Most importantly, this experience reinforced my belief that artificial intelligence is not about replacing people — it’s about augmenting human care with empathy-driven design. As I look ahead, this project continues to guide my mission: to build solutions where logic meets compassion, and where technology doesn't just advance — it uplifts.</p>
