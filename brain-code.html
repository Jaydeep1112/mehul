                            <div class="blog-read">

                                <div class="post-text">
                                   
                                        <p>What began as an autonomous project that united my passion for medicine and technology soon became one of the most significant experiences of my academic career. I created an AI-based diagnostic model and supporting software that can identify pneumonia in chest X-ray images — an endeavor that not only cemented my interest in AI but also allowed me to pay it forward and positively impact my school community and beyond.</p>

                                        <h4>The Concept: Applying AI to Fix Actual Problems</h4>
                                        <p>Motivated by the vision that technology should be for humanity's benefit, I embarked on discovering how artificial intelligence can be applied in medicine. Through research, trial-and-error coding, and iterating deep learning models, I managed to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to accurately diagnose pneumonia. Having established this, I integrated the model into an easy-to-use, intuitive software interface — and brought it within the reach of individuals, including those without technical expertise.</p>

                                        <p>This project did not only teach me about machine learning algorithms and medical imaging — but about determination, ethical responsibility, and the power of purpose-driven innovation.</p>

                                        <h4>Raising Awareness: Speaking Out for Impact</h4>
                                        <p>To make sure my work extended beyond mere technical audiences, I presented at school to illustrate the science of the project and create awareness about the risks of undiagnosed pneumonia. I wanted to show that innovation is not exclusive to labs or corporations — students can do it, too.</p>

                                        <p>This speech created intrigue, particularly with juniors, and resulted in a few questions and discussions regarding AI and health tech. The experience taught me the capability of not just creating solutions — but encouraging others to do so.</p>

                                        <h4>‍From Learner to Mentor</h4>
                                        <p>A short while later, I started mentoring young students interested in AI and coding. I set up casual weekend sessions where I dissected difficult ideas into bite-sized lessons and encouraged them to work on their own projects. Seeing them tinker, learn, and develop was utterly fulfilling — and it signaled the end of being a lone maker and the beginning of being a community creator.</p>

                                        <h4>From Passion to Purpose — and Profession</h4>
                                        <p>When news of my work reached them, several students and parents from outside my school community came out wanting to learn about AI. This created a modest but thrilling entrepreneurial prospect — I started providing private workshops and one-on-one guidance, converting my erstwhile hobby into a paying enterprise. The money was secondary to the knowledge that I was assisting in cultivating the next generation of innovators and that they would go on to make a tangible impact.</p>

                                        <h4>What This Taught Me</h4>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Initiative & Innovation:</strong> I learned how to take an idea from abstract concept to practical application with real-world effects.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Communicating complex concepts to non-technical people taught me the importance of clarity and empathy.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Leadership:</strong> Leading others and being accountable for a project taught me responsibility.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Entrepreneurship:</strong> Translating passion into a sustainable business taught me how to create value — and bring it to market responsibly.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <p>This experience is still one of the most defining chapters of my high school life. It reminded me that technology isn't powerful because it's complicated — it's powerful because of what it can do for people.</p>

                               <div class="post-text">
                                    <p>As an individual who is extremely interested in where technology meets human flourishing, I conducted a personal research project to investigate how Artificial Intelligence patterns can be utilized to transform healthcare — from diagnosis to patient treatment. This was not merely a technical investigation; it was an examination of the ethical, clinical, and technological facets of how machine learning might transform medicine in the coming years.</p>

                                    <p>My work focused on learning and comparing the available AI models applied in the field of healthcare — including medical imaging using convolutional neural networks, natural language processing for healthcare data, and reinforcement learning for optimizing treatment. I read through numerous academic journals, open-source models, and actual use cases from organizations like Stanford and MIT.</p>

                                    <p>Besides theoretical study, I personally tried out a few machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow and PyTorch), modeling diagnostic models and analyzing their performance scores using real-world data samples from NIH and Kaggle.</p>

                                    <h4>Key Questions I Explored:</h4>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>How can AI be employed for better early diagnosis and disease detection?</li>
                                        <li>What are the ethical considerations of machine-driven medical decisions?</li>
                                        <li>Can AI assist in improving healthcare disparities in underprivileged communities?</li>
                                        <li>What determines an AI model in healthcare as explainable, reliable, and safe?</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h4>Outcomes & Findings</h4>
                                    <p>The study led to an in-depth report considering:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Strengths and limitations of different types of AI models in healthcare environments</li>
                                        <li>How the quality of training data determines model bias</li>
                                        <li>Real-world applications across areas such as radiology, oncology, and remote monitoring</li>
                                        <li>Challenges in implementing AI ethically in hospitals and clinical processes</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h4>Growth Through Inquiry</h4>
                                    <p>This study wasn't about coding or data — it was about what responsibility looks like in innovation. It provided me with a first-hand appreciation for how AI needs to be created and implemented with empathy, and always together with human capability.</p>

                                    <p>It taught me to be a scientist — to ask difficult questions, test hypotheses, and remain open to where the data takes me. It also taught me to be a citizen — that solutions for the real world need to be inclusive, ethical, and socially aware.</p>

                                    <h4> Sharing & Inspiring</h4>
                                    <p>Upon completion of the research, I presented my results to students within my school's computer and science clubs, generating discussion of new areas such as biomedical informatics and AI ethics. I also produced a brief explainer paper for younger children to inform them about the promise and hazards of AI for health.</p>

                                    <h4>Why This Matters</h4>
                                    <p>This research cemented my passion for working at the intersection of technology and humanity. It reminded me that artificial intelligence is not about machines — it's about improving life, making it safer and fairer, through intelligent, human-focused design.</p>

                                    <p>I now bring this enthusiasm with a dedication to leveraging technology not only for innovation, but for impact.</p>
