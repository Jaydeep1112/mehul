                            <div class="blog-read">

                                <div class="post-text">
                                   
                                        <p>What began as an autonomous project that united my passion for medicine and technology soon became one of the most significant experiences of my academic career. I created an AI-based diagnostic model and supporting software that can identify pneumonia in chest X-ray images — an endeavor that not only cemented my interest in AI but also allowed me to pay it forward and positively impact my school community and beyond.</p>

                                        <h4>The Concept: Applying AI to Fix Actual Problems</h4>
                                        <p>Motivated by the vision that technology should be for humanity's benefit, I embarked on discovering how artificial intelligence can be applied in medicine. Through research, trial-and-error coding, and iterating deep learning models, I managed to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to accurately diagnose pneumonia. Having established this, I integrated the model into an easy-to-use, intuitive software interface — and brought it within the reach of individuals, including those without technical expertise.</p>

                                        <p>This project did not only teach me about machine learning algorithms and medical imaging — but about determination, ethical responsibility, and the power of purpose-driven innovation.</p>

                                        <h4>Raising Awareness: Speaking Out for Impact</h4>
                                        <p>To make sure my work extended beyond mere technical audiences, I presented at school to illustrate the science of the project and create awareness about the risks of undiagnosed pneumonia. I wanted to show that innovation is not exclusive to labs or corporations — students can do it, too.</p>

                                        <p>This speech created intrigue, particularly with juniors, and resulted in a few questions and discussions regarding AI and health tech. The experience taught me the capability of not just creating solutions — but encouraging others to do so.</p>

                                        <h4>‍From Learner to Mentor</h4>
                                        <p>A short while later, I started mentoring young students interested in AI and coding. I set up casual weekend sessions where I dissected difficult ideas into bite-sized lessons and encouraged them to work on their own projects. Seeing them tinker, learn, and develop was utterly fulfilling — and it signaled the end of being a lone maker and the beginning of being a community creator.</p>

                                        <h4>From Passion to Purpose — and Profession</h4>
                                        <p>When news of my work reached them, several students and parents from outside my school community came out wanting to learn about AI. This created a modest but thrilling entrepreneurial prospect — I started providing private workshops and one-on-one guidance, converting my erstwhile hobby into a paying enterprise. The money was secondary to the knowledge that I was assisting in cultivating the next generation of innovators and that they would go on to make a tangible impact.</p>

                                        <h4>What This Taught Me</h4>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Initiative & Innovation:</strong> I learned how to take an idea from abstract concept to practical application with real-world effects.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Communicating complex concepts to non-technical people taught me the importance of clarity and empathy.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Leadership:</strong> Leading others and being accountable for a project taught me responsibility.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Entrepreneurship:</strong> Translating passion into a sustainable business taught me how to create value — and bring it to market responsibly.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <p>This experience is still one of the most defining chapters of my high school life. It reminded me that technology isn't powerful because it's complicated — it's powerful because of what it can do for people.</p>

                                        <li>What determines an AI model in healthcare as explainable, reliable, and safe?</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h4>Outcomes & Findings</h4>
                                    <p>The study led to an in-depth report considering:</p>
                                    <ul>

                                    <h4>Impact</h4>
                                    <p>This project didn't merely create a model—it created a team, a learning community, and a self-assured, competent leader in me. I became not only a more proficient programmer, but a trustworthy guide, communicator, and entrepreneur.</p>
