                                    <p><span class="dropcap">M</span>y journey into AI began with a deep curiosity about how technology could be used for meaningful change — particularly in healthcare. Combining my interests in medicine and artificial intelligence, I built a diagnostic model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect pneumonia in chest X-ray images. This wasn’t just an academic experiment; I developed and packaged the model into an intuitive software interface, ensuring it was accessible even to non-technical users. It became more than code — it became a practical tool with real-world potential. Presenting the project at school, I emphasized not just the technology, but its purpose: to raise awareness about the dangers of undiagnosed pneumonia and to inspire peers to see innovation as something within reach.</p>

                                    <p>That presentation was a turning point. It sparked meaningful conversations, especially with juniors, about the role of AI in health and everyday life. Recognizing the enthusiasm, I began mentoring students interested in coding and artificial intelligence, holding weekend sessions to simplify complex topics and guide them through beginner projects. These informal classes evolved into a nurturing learning space — one where young minds began experimenting, building, and asking bold questions. As more students and even parents from outside my school expressed interest, I began offering personalized coaching sessions. What had started as a passion project transitioned into a paid venture, giving me the opportunity to turn knowledge into mentorship and purpose into practice — all while supporting the growth of a budding community of student innovators.</p>

                                    <p>Beyond technical skills, this experience taught me lasting lessons in leadership, communication, and entrepreneurship. I learned how to transform an idea into a working solution, how to explain complex AI models to non-specialists, and how to guide others in their learning journey. More importantly, I discovered the power of impact — how technology becomes truly powerful not when it is complicated, but when it is compassionate. This project remains one of the most formative chapters of my academic life, reminding me that even as a student, I can lead with empathy, build with purpose, and spark change — one line of code at a time.</p>

                                    <p>As an individual who is extremely interested in where technology meets human flourishing, I conducted a personal research project to investigate how Artificial Intelligence patterns can be utilized to transform healthcare — from diagnosis to patient treatment. This was not merely a technical investigation; it was an examination of the ethical, clinical, and technological facets of how machine learning might transform medicine in the coming years.</p>

                                    <p>My work focused on learning and comparing the available AI models applied in the field of healthcare — including medical imaging using convolutional neural networks, natural language processing for healthcare data, and reinforcement learning for optimizing treatment. I read through numerous academic journals, open-source models, and actual use cases from organizations like Stanford and MIT.</p>

                                    <p>Besides theoretical study, I personally tried out a few machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow and PyTorch), modeling diagnostic models and analyzing their performance scores using real-world data samples from NIH and Kaggle.</p>

                                    <h4>Key Questions I Explored:</h4>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>How can AI be employed for better early diagnosis and disease detection?</li>
                                        <li>What are the ethical considerations of machine-driven medical decisions?</li>
                                        <li>Can AI assist in improving healthcare disparities in underprivileged communities?</li>
                                        <li>What determines an AI model in healthcare as explainable, reliable, and safe?</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h4>Outcomes & Findings</h4>
                                    <p>The study led to an in-depth report considering:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Strengths and limitations of different types of AI models in healthcare environments</li>
                                        <li>How the quality of training data determines model bias</li>
                                        <li>Real-world applications across areas such as radiology, oncology, and remote monitoring</li>
                                        <li>Challenges in implementing AI ethically in hospitals and clinical processes</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h4>Growth Through Inquiry</h4>
                                    <p>This study wasn't about coding or data — it was about what responsibility looks like in innovation. It provided me with a first-hand appreciation for how AI needs to be created and implemented with empathy, and always together with human capability.</p>

                                    <p>It taught me to be a scientist — to ask difficult questions, test hypotheses, and remain open to where the data takes me. It also taught me to be a citizen — that solutions for the real world need to be inclusive, ethical, and socially aware.</p>

                                    <h4> Sharing & Inspiring</h4>
                                    <p>Upon completion of the research, I presented my results to students within my school's computer and science clubs, generating discussion of new areas such as biomedical informatics and AI ethics. I also produced a brief explainer paper for younger children to inform them about the promise and hazards of AI for health.</p>

                                    <h4>Why This Matters</h4>
                                    <p>This research cemented my passion for working at the intersection of technology and humanity. It reminded me that artificial intelligence is not about machines — it's about improving life, making it safer and fairer, through intelligent, human-focused design.</p>

                                    <p>I now bring this enthusiasm with a dedication to leveraging technology not only for innovation, but for impact.</p>
