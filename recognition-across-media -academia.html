                                        <h4>Times School — The Times of India (Education Supplement)</h4>
                                        <p>My name and work were featured in <strong>Times School</strong>, the education supplement of The <strong>Times of India</strong>, as part of a multi-page profile on student leadership and initiatives at Rustomjee Cambridge International School & Junior College.</p>
                                        <p>The coverage referenced <strong>two distinct strands of my engagement</strong>, each situated in a different educational and social context.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Educational Outreach at the Red Rhino Resource Centre, Kibera (Nairobi)</strong></p>
                                        <p>One section of the feature highlighted my teaching work at the <strong>Red Rhino Resource Centre </strong>in Nairobi’s Kibera community. The article described educational outreach centered on science learning, curiosity-driven engagement, and interaction with children from underserved backgrounds. Rather than framing the work as charity, the coverage emphasized humility, cultural sensitivity, and the responsibility of teaching in environments shaped by limited resources.</p>
                                        <p>This recognition reinforced the importance of approaching education as a shared exchange, where listening, adaptability, and respect matter as much as instruction.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Mentoring Through Applied Artificial Intelligence</strong></p>
                                        <p>A separate section of the same feature covered my role in <strong>conceptualizing and leading AI learning camps</strong> for younger students within my school community. The article highlighted my work introducing foundational AI concepts and guiding students through hands-on, problem-based learning activities.</p>
                                        <p>The emphasis was placed on clarity, responsibility, and the ability to translate abstract technical ideas into accessible learning experiences. The coverage situated these camps within a broader culture of student-led academic initiative and collaborative learning.</p>
                                        <p>Taken together, the Times School feature reflected how the same values—communication, responsibility, and mentorship—can manifest across very different educational settings.</p>

                                    <h4>Dean’s Award for Outstanding Student Leadership in Applied Artificial Intelligence</h4>  
                                        <p>I received the Dean’s Award for Outstanding Student Leadership in Applied Artificial Intelligence in recognition of my role in conceptualizing and leading structured AI learning camps within the school. The award acknowledged my work introducing foundational AI concepts, mentoring peers in developing real-world models, and emphasizing practical application alongside responsible use.</p>
                                        <p>This recognition reflected initiative, subject-matter depth, and the ability to translate complex technical ideas into collaborative learning experiences, evaluated against institutional academic standards.</p>
                                        <h4>Dean’s Award for Excellence in Academic Peer Mentorship</h4>
                                        <p>I was also awarded the <strong>Dean’s Award for Excellence in Academic Peer Mentorship</strong>, recognizing sustained contribution to peer tutoring beyond regular classroom instruction. Through structured academic support, I helped fellow students strengthen conceptual understanding, approach problem-solving with clarity, and build academic confidence.</p>
                                        <p>The award emphasized patience, responsibility, and commitment to collaborative learning rather than individual academic gain, reinforcing the value of peer-led academic culture within the school community.</p>
                                        <h4>Trinity College London — Grade 8 Communication Skills (Distinction)</h4>
                                        <p>I was awarded a Distinction in the Grade 8 Communication Skills examination conducted by Trinity College London, following multi-year progression through the program. The assessment evaluated structured thinking, clarity of expression, active listening, and the ability to engage thoughtfully with unfamiliar perspectives under formal examination conditions.</p>
                                        <p>This recognition reflected disciplined preparation and the ability to communicate ideas with precision and adaptability rather than performance alone. It reinforced my belief that effective communication is not about persuasion, but about listening carefully, responding responsibly, and sustaining meaningful dialogue — skills that have shaped my academic leadership and collaborative work across technical and interdisciplinary settings.</p>

                                    <h4>Mara Youth Development Program</h4>
                                    <p>During my time in Nairobi, I worked closely with <strong>Mr. Chandresh Sagar,</strong> Director of ,<strong>FAIDA Marketplace,</strong> while also volunteering independently at the Red Rhino Resource Centre in Kibera. These experiences unfolded alongside one another and prompted ongoing conversations about access, opportunity, and the importance of designing youth initiatives with long-term continuity rather than short-term intervention.</p>

                                    <p>Through sustained involvement, shared observation, and dialogue, my approach to youth engagement—grounded in consistency, dignity, and responsibility—contributed to how these challenges were framed and discussed. Over time, these conversations and on-ground experiences informed thinking that led to the launch of the <strong>Mara Youth Development Program</strong> under the Mara Sports platform, an initiative focused on identifying and nurturing youth potential through structured, community-centered engagement.</p>
                                    <p>I do not view this as ownership of an idea, but as evidence of how principled action and thoughtful example can influence how others approach responsibility and opportunity. Seeing dialogue evolve into a structured program reinforced a lesson central to my work: meaningful impact often begins by shaping perspective, not by claiming credit.</p>
